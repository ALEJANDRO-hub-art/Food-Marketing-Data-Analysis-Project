**Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer behavior for a food retail/marketing company using historical customer and campaign data. The goal is to understand who spends the most, who is most likely to accept marketing campaigns, and which channels (web, catalog, in-store) are most effective.
Using Python and exploratory data analysis, you engineered key features (e.g., Age_Group, Total_Children, Education_Status, Marital_Status_str, MntTotal) and visualized relationships between:
- Demographics (age, marital status, children, education)
- Purchase behavior (web, catalog, store purchases)
- Total spending (MntTotal)
- Campaign response (Accepted_Campaigns)

From these insights, you define practical customer segments and marketing recommendations to maximize revenue and campaign ROI.

**Business Problem**

The business needs to answer:
Which customers generate the most revenue?
Which customers are most likely to respond to marketing campaigns?
Which channels (web, catalog, store) should we prioritize for marketing efforts?
How should we segment customers to target campaigns more effectively?

Essentially: How can we best allocate marketing budget across customer segments and channels to maximize profit and new spend?
